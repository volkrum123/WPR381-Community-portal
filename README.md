## Overview

Starter boilerplate for a Node.js + Express + EJS website.

## Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server with nodemon.
3. Add your own route handlers and middleware as needed.

## Technologies Used
1. **Node.js(v18+)**: The Node js runtime environment was implemented to handle the server-side for this particular website.
2. **Express.js(v4+)**: Express is a lightweight web framework that was implemented in the pageroute.js and app.js files to handle the routing and server logic.
3. **EJS(v3+)**: We made use of this template engine to generate dynamic HTML elements such as the header and footer through partials and embedded Javascript.
4.**CSS**: Simple Cascade Style Sheets was implemented for the styling of the website
5.**Git and Github**: These version control systems were used for version control and fostered collaboration among the group. 
6.**Nodemon**: A technology that is used for running the server live during development
