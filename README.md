# Community Portal Project

## Project Title:


## Overview:

Starter boilerplate for a Node.js + Express + EJS website.

## Technologies Used
1. **Node.js(v18+)**: The Node js runtime environment was implemented to handle the server-side for this particular website.
2. **Express.js(v4+)**: Express is a lightweight web framework that was implemented in the pageroute.js and app.js files to handle the routing and server logic.
3. **EJS(v3+)**: We made use of this template engine to generate dynamic HTML elements such as the header and footer through partials and embedded Javascript.
4.**CSS**: Simple Cascade Style Sheets was implemented for the styling of the website
5.**Git and Github**: These version control systems were used for version control and fostered collaboration among the group. 
6.**Nodemon**: A technology that is used for running the server live during development

## Team Members and Roles:

## Setup Instructions:

1. **Github repository:**

Our team lead (Stiaan Megit) created a repository called (community portal) on his github account. He made the rest of the team members collaborates to the repository giving them access to the ptoject.

2. **Boilerplate upload:**

We were given the following file structure for our project:

We added a JS folder to the public folder, then we committed this file structure to our github repository via VScode.

3. **Installing dependencies:**

In order to build a Node.js + Express.js Server-Side website we needed to locally install the following packages in the project folder to gain access to certain functionality:

- **Node.js(v18+)**
- **Express.js(v4+)**
- **Nodemon**
- **NPM**

4. **Running the development Server:**

We activated the development server using "npm run dev". This restarts the browser and updates the webpage when we changed the a backend javascript code.

## Reflection:

1. **Home page:**We could've added more content to the body of the home page besides the upcomming-event placeholder.

2. **Event page:** We could've added a better background to reduce its white color scheme and more information about its location. We could've also added a search bar were you could search for specific events
